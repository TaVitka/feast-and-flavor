    <p>
      Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the website and Services, where you are
      located in
      the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes;
      this,
      however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy
      Act
      or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement
      with you
      and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
      obligation
      to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in
      the
      exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
      interests
      pursued by us or by a third party.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by
      opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we
      will be
      happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision
      of
      Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a
      contract.
    </p>

    <h2>
      5. Managing information
    </h2>

    <p>
      You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may
      change as the website and Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy
      of the
      unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our
      affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below. If you would like to delete your Personal
      Information or

    </p>

    <h2>
      6. Disclosure of information
    </h2>

    <p>
      Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have
      requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work with us, any
      other
      affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the website and Services available to you.
      We do
      not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties. These service providers are not authorized to use
      or
      disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.
      We
      may share your Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are
      consistent
      with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. These third parties are
      given
      Personal Information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them
      to use
      or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to
      comply
      with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
      protect
      our
      rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
    </p>

    <h2>
      7. Retention of information
    </h2>

    <p>
      We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations,
      resolve
      disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use
      any
      aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in
      a
      manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be
      deleted.
      Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability
      cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.
    </p>

    <h2>
      8. Transfer of information
    </h2>

    <p>
      Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country
      other than
      your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the
      European
      Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more
      countries, such
      as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes
      place,
      you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this Policy or inquire with us using the information
      provided
      in the contact section.

      processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of
      or on
      pre-contractual obligations thereof.
    </p>

    <h2>
      10. The right to object to processing

    <p>
      The GDPR distinguishes between organizations that process personal information for their own purposes (known as

      15. Legal Bases for Processing Your Personal Information
    </h2>

    <p>
      We will only collect and use your personal information when we have a legal right to do so. In which case, we will
      collect and use your personal information lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. If you are under 18 years
      of
      age, we will seek your parent or legal guardian’s consent to process your personal information for that specific

    <p>
      Consent From You: Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information for a specific purpose.
      You may
      withdraw your consent at any time using the facilities we provide; however this will not affect any use of your
      information that has already taken place. When you contact us, you may consent to your name and email address
      being used
      so we can respond to your enquiry. While you may request that we delete your contact details at any time, we
      cannot
      recall any email we have already sent. If you have any further enquiries about how to withdraw your consent,
      please feel
      free to enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Performance of a Contract or Transaction: Where you have entered into a contract or transaction with us, or in
      order to
      take preparatory steps prior to our entering into a contract or transaction with you. For example, if you contact
      us
      with an enquiry, we may require personal information such as your name and contact details in order to respond.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our Legitimate Interests: Where we assess it is necessary for our legitimate interests, such as for us to provide,
      operate, improve and communicate our services. We consider our legitimate interests to include research and
      development,
      understanding our audience, marketing and promoting our services, measures taken to operate our services
      efficiently,
      marketing analysis, and measures taken to protect our legal rights and interests.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Compliance with Law</b>
    </p>

    <p>

      have any
      further enquiries about how we retain personal information in order to comply with the law, please feel free to

      approved by the European Commission, or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.

    <h2>
      17. Your Rights and Controlling Your Personal Information
    </h2>

    <p>
      Restrict: You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information if (i) you
      are
      concerned about the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) you believe your personal information has been
      unlawfully processed; (iii) you need us to maintain the personal information solely for the purpose of a legal
      claim; or
      (iv) we are in the process of considering your objection in relation to processing on the basis of legitimate
      interests.
    </p>

    <p>
      Objecting to processing: You have the right to object to processing of your personal information that is based on
      our
      legitimate interests or public interest. If this is done, we must provide compelling legitimate grounds for the
      processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedoms, in order to proceed with the processing of your
      personal information.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data portability: You may have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you. Where
      possible, we will provide this information in CSV format or other easily readable machine format. You may also
      have the
      right to request that we transfer this personal information to a third party.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deletion: You may have a right to request that we delete the personal information we hold about you at any time,
      and we
      will take reasonable steps to delete your personal information from our current records. If you ask us to delete
      your
      personal information, we will let you know how the deletion affects your use of our website or products and
      services.
      There may be exceptions to this right for specific legal reasons which, if applicable, we will set out for you in
      response to your request. If you terminate or delete your account, we will delete your personal information within
      30
      days of the deletion of your account. Please be aware that search engines and similar third parties may still
      retain
      copies of your personal information that has been made public at least once, like certain profile information and
      public
      comments, even after you have deleted the information from our services or deactivated your account.
