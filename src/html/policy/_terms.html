  <h2>1. About These Terms of Use.</h2>

  <p>
    Feast and Flavor (“Feast and Flavor”, “we”, “us” or “our”), operates
    several websites, including this website (each a “Site” and
    collectively, the “Sites”). By using or accessing this Site, a mobile
    application of this Site, or any of the Site’s Content (as defined
    below), you acknowledge that you agree to and are subject to the
    following terms and conditions of service (the “Terms”). The Terms
    constitute a legally binding agreement between you and
    Feast and Flavor as the owner or operator of the Site. You covenant,
    represent and warrant that you have any and all authorizations as may
    be necessary to enter into this agreement and that your use of the
    Site, including provision or use of any Content (defined below), does
    not violate any applicable law. If you are using the Site on behalf of
    an employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have
    the authority to bind such entity to the Terms. You must be a resident
    of the United States (including its territorial possessions) and at
    least eighteen (18) years of age to access and use the Site. These
    provisions form an essential basis of our bargain.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you do not agree to these Terms, you are not authorized to access
    or use the Site or the services offered on the Site. Stop using any
    services and exit the Site.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because we provide a wide range of services, we may ask you to review
    and accept supplemental terms that apply to a specific product,
    service, or app. To the extent those supplemental terms conflict with
    the Terms, the supplemental terms associated with the product,
    service, or app govern with respect to your use of such product,
    service, or app to the extent of the conflict.
  </p>

  <p>
    Notice Regarding Dispute Resolution: These Terms contain provisions
    that govern how disputes between you and Feast and Flavor are
    resolved, including an agreement to arbitrate, which will, with
    limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us to
    binding and final arbitration and limit you to claims against
    Feast and Flavor on an individual basis.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Consent and Privacy.</h2>

  <p>
    By clicking on any button indicating an acceptance or agreement to
    terms, a continuance of processing, a request for quotes or additional
    information or any other submission (“submission”), you understand
    that you are agreeing to the stated terms and conditions of that
    submission and that you are submitting an inquiry as to (type of
    service) services through Feast and Flavor to service providers and
    companies and other third parties who are customers of our Site, such
    as marketing partners (each, a “Provider”), to whom your inquiry is
    transmitted. The inquiry is about quotes for catering or another
    product or service. By including your telephone number and email
    address in any submission, you are extending an express invitation and
    providing your express written consent to Feast and Flavor and to each
    and every Provider you have been matched with (i) to contact you by
    telephone at the numbers you have provided (including through
    auto-dialed, pre-recorded, artificial voice and/or text messages) so
    they may assist you with your transaction and you hereby consent to
    any such calls or texts even if your phone number is on any corporate,
    state or national Do Not Call list or registry, or (ii) to contact you
    by email at any email address you provided. You are not required to
    provide your consent to be contacted in order to purchase or receive
    goods or services, however. You represent that all of the information
    you have provided in your submission is true and complete. By
    submitting information on an quote request form or similar form on our
    Site, you authorize us to provide such information to Providers in
    order to help you complete your inquiry (including providing you with
    information about other products or services in which you have
    expressed an interest). Additionally, where applicable, you authorize
    the Providers to verify the accuracy and authenticity of all
    information supplied by you, both internally and with the assistance
    of unaffiliated third parties or credit bureaus.

    Site, Feast and Flavor to add your telephone number and email address
    to our database of users. You may receive one or more marketing calls
    or emails from the Site, Feast and Flavor. You may opt not to receive
    such marketing emails from us at any time. Please review our

    digital interactions with our Sites. We may engage the services of
    outside vendors to help us perform this compliance activity.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Our Services.</h2>

  <p>
    We are not a home improvement Service Provider. Instead, the Site acts
    as a venue to allow Providers to offer catering and other
    opportunities to consumers (each, a “Prospect”; all Prospects and
    Providers are referred to together as the Site’s “users”) who have
    visited one of our Sites or affiliated sites and given their
    information to be contacted by companies offering catering
    services. We do not offer any products or services described on the
    Site, nor do we engage in other consumer financial transactions.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Personal Use.</h2>

  <p>
    Although we do charge a fee to Providers to purchase Leads or
    information we gather from our Sites, and we may from time to time
    charge users fees for utilizing various other services that may now or
    in the future be provided by our Site, we do not charge users to
    access the public portions of our Site. Accordingly, we grant each
    user a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to access the Site in
    order to, as applicable, view or make legitimate inquiries to us
    regarding our Service, all in accordance with these Terms. We further
    grant each Provider a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to
    access the password-protected portions of the Site or the Service (as
    applicable) in accordance with these Terms or any written agreement
    between us and the Provider. Any other use of the Site or the Service
    is expressly prohibited. Importantly, this limited license does not
    include any right of collection, aggregation, copying, duplication,
    display or modification of the Site or the Service nor any right of
    use of data mining, robots, spiders or similar data gathering and
    extraction tools without our prior written permission; provided,
    however, that a limited exception from the foregoing exclusion is
    provided to general purpose internet search engines and non-commercial
    public archives that use tools to gather information for the sole
    purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Site, provided that they each
    do so from a stable IP address or range of IP addresses using an
    easily identifiable agent and comply with our robots.txt file.

    services, materials and information made available on or accessed
    through the Sites or the service, are provided “as is.” We expressly
    disclaim all express or implied warranties, including, without
    limitation, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness for a
    particular purpose, completeness and accuracy. To the fullest extent
    permissible by law, we make no representations or warranties of any

    nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, which now or hereafter
    arise from, relate to, or are connected with such dispute and/or your
    use of the Sites or the service. If you are a California resident, you
    waive California civil code section 1542, which says: “a general
    release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or
    suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the
    release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected
    his or her settlement with the debtor” (or any equivalent statutory
    provision with a similar import or intent). If you are a resident of a
    state other than California, you explicitly waive the terms and
    protections of any statute of your own state that has a similar import
    or intent.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Indemnity.</h2>

    You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Site and each
    member of Feast and Flavor (collectively, the “indemnified parties”)
    harmless from and against any and all liability and costs (including,
    without limitation, attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by the
    indemnified parties in connection with any claim arising out of your
    use of the Sites (including, without limitation, any dispute between a

    these terms or the representations, warranties and covenants made by
    you herein. You shall cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the
    defense of any claim. Feast and Flavor reserves the right, at our own
    expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
    otherwise subject to indemnification by you and you shall not in any
    event settle any matter without our prior written consent.

    written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and
    conclusions on which an award is based. All issues are for the
    arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and
    enforceability of the arbitration provisions in this Section are for a
    court to decide. ANY AWARD RENDERED SHALL BE FINAL AND CONCLUSIVE TO

    COMPETENT JURISDICTION. IN THE EVENT THAT ONE OF THE PARTIES TO THE
