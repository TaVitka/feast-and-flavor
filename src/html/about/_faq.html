          How far in advance should I book catering services for my event?
        </summary>

        <div>
          <p>
            We recommend booking catering services as early as possible to ensure availability for your desired date.
            Ideally, we suggest booking at least 2-3 months in advance, especially for peak wedding and event seasons.
            However, we understand that sometimes plans change, so don't hesitate to reach out to us even if your event
            is coming up soon.
