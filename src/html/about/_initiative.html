        Sustainability Initiatives
      </h2>

      <p>
        At Feast and Flavor, sustainability is at the core of every decision we make, from menu creation to event
        execution. We are committed to sourcing local and seasonal ingredients, supporting our community's farmers and
        reducing our carbon footprint.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our waste reduction initiative focuses on minimizing food waste and using eco-friendly materials, ensuring that
        our events are as environmentally friendly as they are elegant. Through these practices, we strive to lead by
        example in the catering industry, proving that exceptional catering can go hand-in-hand with environmental
        responsibility.
